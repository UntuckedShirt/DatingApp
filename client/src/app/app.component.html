<!-- below is an interpolation from the .tscomponent -->
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<!-- we want to loop through each user to diaplay details in list items -->
<!-- when looping in angular you want to use a structural derective ex. ngFor-->
<!-- *ngFor goes inside the closing angle bracket
you then need to use interpolation-->
<!-- angular is case sensitive. Make sure you follow the rules of convention-->
<ul>
    <li *ngFor='let user of users'>{{user.id}} - 
    {{user.userName}}</li>
</ul>
